# slippage

An optimal execution and transaction cost analysis engine.

The library answers two questions that sit either side of a trade:

- **After the fact** — what did this order actually cost, and where did the cost
  come from: the delay before it reached the market, the impact of trading it,
  or the part that never got done?
- **Before the fact** — given a market impact model and a tolerance for risk,
  how should the remaining quantity be spread over the trading horizon?

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the build order.
